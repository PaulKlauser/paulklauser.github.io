I'm motivated by solving problems. In my professional career, that largely manifests as building and delivering software.
In my personal life it often takes a more physical and mechanical form through building and racing cars. It's surprising to some
how similar these endeavors end up being.

Most of my engineering experience has been through agency work, where I was able to see a large set of diverse projects
and problems in a relatively short amount of time. I've worked as an on-the-ground engineer -- implementing patterns to help guide
teams of developers, up to a pure consulting role -- interviewing technical leadership and individual contributors to assess and root-cause
delivery problems on teams.

Everything I've learned has come from working, talking, and disagreeing with people smarter than myself. I strongly believe that's
the only way we grow. I hope as I publish things here, more smart people come out to disagree with me, agree with me, and continue the conversation!
